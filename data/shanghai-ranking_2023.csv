The reputation of the University of Bonn for excellence in research is rooted in a long tradition. The University was founded in 1818 by Friedrich-Wilhelm III, the Prussian king whose name it bears. Imbued with the spirit of Wilhelm von Humboldt, the University quickly joined the circle of Germany’s most distinguished universities and became a major pole of attraction for leading scholars. The list of famous professors ranges from the astronomer Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander (1799-1875), through the chemist August Kekulé von Stradonitz (1829–1896) and political economist Josef Schumpeter (1883–1950) to the philologist Ernst Robert Curtius (1886–1956) and the theologists Karl Barth (1886–1968) and Joseph Ratzinger (born 1927), later to become Pope Benedict XVI._x000D_
Today, the University of Bonn is a modern research university with a strong international orientation and a clear research profile. The University has developed internationally renowned areas of excellence in the fields of mathematics, economics, physics/astronomy, chemistry,  biosciences, pharmacology, genetic medicine, immunology, neurosciences and ethics._x000D_
Other disciplines, such as geosciences and law, are of outstanding importance within the German research scene._x000D_
In recent years, the University of Bonn has proven its research potential and its commitment to academic excellence in numerous ways. The University can boast of a long list of award-winning scientists and scholars, e.g., with more than a dozen Leibniz Prize winners. Indeed, in the last 25 years two professors have received the Nobel Prize: Wolfgang Paul (for Physics, 1989) and Reinhard Selten (for Economics, 1994)._x000D_
Employing a range of funding instruments, the University makes every effort to further sharpen its profile and to offer its top-level researchers the best possible conditions in which to work. High-achieving research fields are granted special allocations for staffing, facilities and materials. The University rewards successful bids for third-party funding with its own allocations under a bonus system and supports the best initiatives for new collaborative projects with seed money awarded through an internal competition. In this way, successful researchers receive recognition and reinforcement for their efforts._x000D_
National and International Research Cooperation_x000D_
As a research university, the University of Bonn builds alliances with strong partners at all levels. It has developed close relations with the major research institutions in the region such as the Forschungszentrum Jülich, the Deutsche Zentrum für Luft und Raumfahrt (DLR), the Center for Advanced Studies and Research (caesar), the newly founded German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) and the local institutes of the Fraunhofer Society and Max Planck Society._x000D_
Internationally, the University of Bonn has established a wide-ranging network of partners both at the institutional and interpersonal level: Active cooperation and exchange agreements with more than 300 institutions around the globe form a sound basis for the university’s international reputation. Academics from Bonn are working in more than 1,500 international research groups or projects with colleagues from around the globe. The University strongly supports further initiatives for collaboration with other universities and research institutions._x000D_
Similarly, the University hosts a constantly growing number of international researchers – a trend confirmed by Bonn’s leading position in the statistics on grants and fellowships awarded by organizations like the prestigious Alexander von Humboldt-Foundation._x000D_
Research-oriented teaching_x000D_
With about 36,000 students Bonn ranks among the big German universities. Each year more than 3,000 students graduate from Bonn; and in addition around 700 doctorates are awarded. Bonn is a classic university with a full range of courses. It offers about 90 undergraduate programs ranging from A for Asian Studies to Z for Zoology, with many interdisciplinary and international course models._x000D_
In order to recruit excellent international PhD students for the University’s key research areas, the University of Bonn has established the Bonn International Graduate School (BIGS) system. These purely English-taught PhD-programs in fields such as mathematics, economics, physics/astronomy, pharmaceutical science and chemical biology have strongly contributed to Bonn’s character as a truly international research university._x000D_
Infrastructure_x000D_
The University of Bonn and the City of Bonn are closely intertwined. The University owns or uses more than 350 buildings throughout the Bonn area. The most impressive building, located in the heart of the City, is undoubtedly the historic Main Building, which was originally the palatial residence of the prince elector and is now home to the Faculties of Philosophy and Theology as well as the University Administration. Together with the adjacent Hofgarten park, this architectural landmark is an important ingredient of the University’s unmistakable charm. Other important university sites include the nearby Juridicum (Faculty of Law and Economics) and the grand buildings in the Poppelsdorf district, housing Pre-clinical Medicine, Agriculture and Natural Sciences. The research institutes and teaching hospitals of the Medical School are located above the City in Bonn’s Venusberg district. Newly constructed or acquired buildings, such as the state-of-the-art Life and Medical Sciences (LIMES) building or the Hausdorff  Centre for Mathematics, which is housed in a distinctive palace-like building from the early 20th century, reflect the University’s successful effort to develop an infrastructure corresponding to its research profile.",38043,13,19561,10.1,7793,20.1,50.7338124,7.1022465

The university also insists on the school-operational characteristic of having “a high staring point, a profound foundation, strict requirements and focusing on practice,” which continually carves out and innovates and diligently trains people. Among XJTU's outstanding alumni are Cai E, Huang Yanpei, Shao Lizi, Li Shutong, Ling Hongxun, Zou Taofen, Lu Dingyi, Hou Shaoqiu, Qian Xuesen, Wang An, Tian Binggeng, and Jiang Zemin. Over 200 XJTU alumni, including Mao Yisheng, Wu Youxun, Zhu Wuhua, Zhang Guangdou, Zhang Wei and Wu Wenjun, all of whom have been honored with membership in the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering. Since moving to Xi'an over 50 years ago, XJTU has educated a large group of talented individuals in many fields, its graduates having achieved distinction in all walks of life._x000D_
In recent years, the university has been following a path of active exploration and bold innovation as it seeks to implement the national reform plan for the comprehensive restructuring of higher education. An important element of this reform is the new “2+4+X” model for research universities; a model which emphasizes providing the students with a solid foundation of general knowledge, sound research skills and the ability to innovate. The goal is to transform the university from one which simply transmits knowledge to one which emphasizes active engagement in research. In 2006, XJTU took the lead among Chinese universities when it undertook to create a system of residential colleges modeled on the traditional Chinese academy of learning. This twin college system is aimed at giving our students the best possible chance for success. In 2007, XJTU established the “Qian Xuesen Experimental Class” for particularly gifted students and the “Zonglian Experimental Class”, whose purpose is to develop an appropriate classroom model for medical education. The university also set up its “engineering workshop” to stimulate students’ interests in science and technology and to encourage innovation and creativity, in keeping with the adage that “small inventions lead to big creations.” In 2010, the university first Experimental Class for Talents of Basic Subject was started. As one of only two universities in China with a “class for gifted young people,” XJTU has received praise from students and parents alike for its unique educational model, its favorable study environment, excellent teachers and substantial teaching resources, and its positive good teaching results. So far, the university has received 60 national teaching awards. In addition, it currently has 34 national elite courses, 8 national–level teaching centers, and 9 national-level teaching teams. To date, 26 XJTU dissertations have been recipients of the annual award given to “China's 100 best doctoral dissertations”; another 40 have been nominated for that award._x000D_
Research in science and technology at XJTU is directed primarily at meeting the nation's most important needs, forging into international frontiers, contributing to autonomous creation and accelerate industrial application. To this end, XJTU is continually strengthening its capacity to innovate while seeking to raise its level of competitiveness. Since 2000, faculty members and researchers from XJTU have headed 13 projects under the 973 Program. In the same period, university scientists and engineers have had 1,489 projects approved by the National Natural Science Fund. Its total number of basic research projects and grants places XJTU in the front rank among Chinese universities. Since 2000, the university has been awarded 31 national science and technology prizes as the first author. To produce these results, the university relies on its strength in key disciplines and on its unique educational model, with its emphasis on the integration of production, study and research. In addition, it has, in cooperation with the government and with large and mid-sized enterprises, established research and development parks whose aim is to help solve the key technological problems facing industry and to strengthen the contributions of science and technology to the regional economy and of local social development._x000D_

As one of Japan's most reputable institutions of higher learning, the Institute has undertaken education and research of the highest quality since 1881. Last year's 130th anniversary was a perfect reminder to refocus on our three pillars: People, Research and Contribution. Through the nurturing of creative people at the top of their scientific fields, and the promotion of cutting edge research, we always strive to contribute in meaningful ways to society. The Institute has three undergraduate schools, six graduate schools, five leading laboratories and multiple research and education centers producing graduates who excel in conducting research that meets the demands of society and industry. Nothing gives us greater pleasure than to be the first preference when it comes to employers seeking to recruit top engineers, or students choosing a career in science and technology. Our faculties and departments are active in the most advanced fields and occupy an important position in the global academic community, thanks to their internationally recognized research. We have initiated twelve projects so far with the support of the 21st Century Center of Excellence (COE) program, sponsored by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sport, Science and Technology (MEXT). In addition, five projects in 2007, three in 2008 and one in 2009 have been selected for the successor program called Global COE, which will further enhance the functions of research and education in the university. The Institute also secured funding in 2005 as a super COE program from MEXT and established an Integrated Research Institute (IRI), which aggregates and disseminates knowledge across departments in order to create solutions for the future problems of society, from energy security to the effects of burgeoning medical costs. The Institute is also active through many educational programs. Seven projects were launched as part of the support program for improving graduate school education by MEXT in 2007. The Productive Leader Incubation Platform and Gender Equality Center began life in 2008. Emphasis on creativity as part of our educational philosophy has produced a great number of famous graduates, including Dr. Hideki Shirakawa, the 2000 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry. One key mission of the Institute is indeed to foster creativity in our students, but creativity built on a comprehensive grasp of the fundamentals of knowledge. The center for Monotsukuri (Making Things) embodies this with its unique hands-on programs that help give shape to ideas, supporting students to physically create and enjoy the sense of accomplishment that comes with building actual things. Other noteworthy projects include: the new upgrade of our supercomputer ""TSUBAME,"" one of the fastest in Japan, the establishment of the Global Edge Institute to train young researchers from all over the world, the expansion of joint programs with overseas partner universities, the new library on the Ookayama Campus, and a new building on Suzukakedai to further improve collaboration with industry.The recently opened Alumni Hall (Tokodai Kuramae Kaikan) is also a testament to the strength and importance of our alumni network as a channel to promote fruitful exchanges with society. Tokyo Institute of Technology is open to the world. It is a matter of great pride that our research and educational activities have been given gradually higher ratings in international surveys over the years, for example, being ranked 57th in the THE-QS 2011 World University Rankings, and 20th for Engineering/Technology.

Our ‘founding father’ was Sir Stafford Northcote, a prominent politician in the Disraeli government, who seized on the popular enthusiasm for learning following the Great Exhibition of 1851. In 1855 he backed the establishment of a School of Art in Exeter, offering subjects ranging from construction to freehand drawing. A School of Science quickly followed in 1863._x000D_
Under a national scheme to extend university education beyond the traditional centres of Oxford and Cambridge, the Exeter Technical and University Extension College was created in 1893 with generous funding from the University of Cambridge. In 1900 the title of Royal Albert Memorial College was adopted, which is where the students’ RAM bar of today gets its name from. In 1911 it expanded into new premises in the city centre, now home to the Exeter Phoenix arts centre._x000D_
The 1920s saw significant expansion and a push for university status, and in 1922 a local benefactor, Alderman WH Reed, purchased the Streatham Estate, on the edge of the city centre, as a new home. Shortly afterwards, the University Grants Committee visited the campus and awarded Exeter the status of University College and an annual government grant._x000D_
We achieved university status in 1955, with James Cook becoming our first Vice-Chancellor. Her Majesty The Queen visited in 1956 to present the charter. In the 1960s we secured sufficient government funding to radically develop campus; over a dozen major new buildings were constructed, including the Great Hall, Devonshire House, and the Physics building, and student numbers rose from 1,400 to 3,300._x000D_
The new century has been an unparalleled period of progress and success. In 2001 His Highness Sheikh Dr Sultan bin Muhammad Al-Qasimi, the Ruler of Sharjah and an Exeter graduate, provided a new building for the Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies. In 2002 we secured government backing for the Peninsula Medical School, a joint project with Plymouth University, and in 2004 we opened our Penryn Campus with Falmouth University in Cornwall. In 2007, partly in recognition of these initiatives, we were named University of the Year at the Times Higher Education Awards._x000D_
Since 2009 we have invested £500 million in our campuses, constructing new student accommodation, refurbishing science labs and study spaces, and developing cutting-edge new buildings such as the Forum, which was opened at Streatham Campus by Her Majesty The Queen in 2012, and the Exchange in Cornwall, which seamlessly merge academic and social space in spectacular architecture. Other significant developments include the Environment and Sustainability Institute, an interdisciplinary research centre at Penryn, and the Research, Innovation, Learning and Development building, a partnership with the Royal Devon & Exeter NHS Foundation Trust, part-funded by the Wellcome Trust and The Wolfson Foundation._x000D_
This investment has helped reap further rewards; in 2012 we were invited to join the prestigious Russell Group of research-intensive universities, and in 2013 we were crowned Sunday Times University of the Year.

The vision of a Planet with seemingly unlimited resources is coming to an end, and the world needs to sustainably manage limited and finite natural resources. Continuing human population growth increases the need for goods and services, resulting in substantial alteration of most ecosystems on Earth and food safety difficulties for the most fragile populations. At the same time, populations face novel health problems that may be linked to environmental issues or lifestyles (infectious diseases, chronic pathologies). Resulting factors – such as biodiversity loss, climate change, disturbance of the water cycle, changes in land use (urbanization, deforestation, intensive farming), food and nutrition insecurity, increasing number of toxic agents – bring the world to face unprecedented challenges and rely on scientific research for providing sustainable solutions to a series of issues that include: emerging diseases in man, plants, and animals, human health alterations, increasing pressure on ecosystems and the environment, non-sustainable management of natural resources such as those derived from agriculture, forestry, fisheries and aquaculture systems, and more._x000D_

the first to exemplify the idea of a Gymnasium Omnium Disciplinarum - an educational model_x000D_
that can now be seen throughout the world. Though the university's year of foundation is_x000D_
generally given as 1222, that in fact only marks the date from which there are records of a ""fixed_x000D_
and publicly recognised university established within the city"" and so the actual foundation can_x000D_
be dated even early, to a period when a number of professors and students had left the_x000D_
University of Bologna as a result of ""offences to academic freedom and the failure to observe the_x000D_
privileges that had been guaranteed to teachers and pupils"". Such exchanges of personnel and_x000D_
students - together with the similarities in the Statutes of the two foundations - reveal that Padua_x000D_
placed a certain importance on this link with what was the oldest university in the world, against_x000D_
which it was however very soon setting itself up as a rival (and even centuries later that rivalry_x000D_
has lost none of its edge).University of Padua was not founded as the result of a charter granted_x000D_
by pope of emperor, but as a ""response to the specific social and cultural conditions that created_x000D_
a need for it""; and its motto of Universa Universis Patavina Libertas was well-deserved not only_x000D_
under the original Commune of the thirteenth century but also during the fourteenth-century_x000D_
rule of the Carraresi and throughout the period of Venetian rule of the city (from the 15th to the_x000D_
18th century), all these different authorities guaranteeing full respect for the university's_x000D_
freedoms. The fifteenth century would see the beginning of more than three hundred years of_x000D_
growth in prestige as the University of Padua benefited from the protection of the Venetian_x000D_
2_x000D_
Republic, which was determined that this should be the only Gymnasium Omnium Disciplinarum_x000D_
within its territories. It was during this period that Padua made its great contribution to the_x000D_
nascent scientific revolution, with developments in philosophical thought, in the study of_x000D_
medicine and anatomy and the great discoveries in astronomy, physics and mathematics that are_x000D_
linked with the eighteen-year period that Galileo Galilei taught at the university (from 1592 to_x000D_
1610).During the seventeenth and eighteenth century, as universities spread throughout Europe_x000D_
and ideas were exchanged backwards and forwards across the continent, the role of Padua_x000D_
University changed; however, it still maintained its unique position within the Venetian Republic,_x000D_
and the eminence of its professors meant it continued to hold a high place both within and_x000D_
without Italy. Amongst the figures associated with the University at this time, one might mention:_x000D_
Domenico Guglielmi, Bernardino Ramazzini, Gian Battista Morgagni, Gian Battista Poleni, Antonio_x000D_
Vallisneri and Giuseppe Toaldo, with the students including Carlo Goldoni, Ugo Foscolo, Giuseppe_x000D_
Tartini and Giacomo Casanova.The political role of the university was particularly apparent in the_x000D_
nineteenth century, when its professors and students took part in the local uprising of February_x000D_
1848 against the Austrian occupation; and again in the First World War, Padua would find itself_x000D_
the centre of the zone of operations bordering on the Austrian Front. Just a few decades later,_x000D_

live up to its motto by taking a leading role in the struggle against the Nazi occupation of 1943-45;_x000D_

struggle, the university would later receive the Gold Medal for Valour, the only university in Italy_x000D_

More than 500 years later, the University continues to make history in Medicine, the Sciences and Humanities, combining excellent teaching with cutting-edge research. Researchers in Tübingen are breaking new ground in many fields – neuroscience, plant molecular biology, pharmaceuticals, cell biochemistry, environmental geoscience, elementary particle physics, educational research, archaeology and linguistics, to name just a few. The University encourages interdisciplinary research to broaden academic and scientific horizons and to promote creativity._x000D_
The University of Tübingen is continually developing new fields of research that encompass both basic research and application-oriented approaches. The University also offers advice on patents and start-ups to graduates whose ideas have commercial potential._x000D_
Outstanding achievement in basic research, whether in individual projects of collaborative research schemes, is a distinguishing feature at Tübingen. This is true of the whole range of subjects, from the Social Sciences (including Political Science and Education) to Mathematics and the Cognitive Sciences (which combine cognitive processes at human and machine level, including psychology and information technology), as well as applied research which probes the interplay of materials and sensors with living systems. The latest rankings place Tübingen among the top universities in Germany and in Europe. In the Humanities and Natural Sciences in particular, it was rated in the top range by the Centre for Higher Education Development (CHE)._x000D_
The broad range of externally funded projects also underscores the quality of Tübingen’s research work. One of the most important sources here is the German Research Foundation (DFG), which primarily fosters high-level basic research and outstanding young researchers. It does so by way of different programs (such as local and trans-regional Collaborative Research Centers, “Excellence Clusters”, Research Training Groups and sponsored research groups). Currently, nine Collaborative Research Centers are in place at the University of Tübingen, along with ten Research Training Groups, across many specialist areas. All of these research projects – some of them in cooperation with partner institutions in Germany or other countries - are aimed at boosting broad-based multidisciplinary research._x000D_
The University and its top research areas have attracted a number of non-University research institutions that have set up branches in Tübingen, e.g. Max-Planck-Institute and research centers of the Helmholtz-Association. The compactness of the town means distances within Tübingen are relatively short._x000D_
Teaching at the University reflects its strong research profile in the natural sciences and humanities. Over 280 courses are offered by its seven Faculties. Innovative new options are constantly being added, such as International Economics, Medical Technology, Geoecology, Bioinformatics and Media Informatics. Students can choose from several different target qualifications, including Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees, the German Staatsexamen or PhD programs._x000D_
Like research, teaching at Tübingen has become increasingly international. Agreements with foreign universities make it possible to acquire a dual degree in selected fields of study, for example, such as Economics and Business Administration, History, Physics, Mathematics and Literature, with students spending one or more semesters at foreign universities. International Master’s courses held in English are a further option. These are already well established in applied Environmental and Geosciences, Neurology and Behavioral Research, Computer Linguistics and International Economics and Finance. The University’s international outreach is also impressive: some 13 percent of the student population comes from outside Germany, and every year 800 students from Tübingen participate in exchange programs with foreign research institutions and universities._x000D_
Tradition and innovation complement each other at the University of Tübingen. The University's history began in the late fifteenth century, when Count Eberhard the Bearded of Württemberg was given permission from the Pope to establish a place of learning. In Tübingen’s historical center there is hardly a building or a square that is not linked to a renowned scholar. Hegel, Hölderlin and Schelling, Mörike, Uhland and Kepler are among Tübingen's notables._x000D_
Over the centuries, Tübingen’s scientific research has repeatedly earned it the esteem of the global academic community. As early as 1863, Germany’s first independent Faculty of Natural Sciences was established here. Its teaching staff included Felix Hoppe-Seyler (1825-1895), who gave the blood pigment hemoglobin its name and is considered the father of modern biochemistry. One of his pupils, Friedrich Miescher (1844-1895), isolated a substance that he called “nucleic acid” while working on white blood cells in his laboratory in Hohentübingen Castle. Based on its chemical composition, it was later renamed deoxyribonucleic acid – DNA – the bearer of hereditary information. It has, of course, since become the focus of intensive research in Tübingen and around the world._x000D_
Along with Biochemistry, Medicine is among Tübingen’s strengths. Earlier than at other universities, the study of Medicine in Tübingen was geared towards investigating diseases in patients, rather than being restricted to the acquisition of theoretical knowledge. For the first time, patients were able to benefit directly from new discoveries. Germany’s first university hospital, founded in Tübingen in 1805, was part of this new approach._x000D_
Tübingen today remains a place of research and teaching. In addition to the nearly 85,000 inhabitants, there are 27,000 German and international students. Some 400 professors and more than 4000 other academic staff teach at the University’s seven Faculties.",27901,14,19561,10.1,7793,20.1,48.5298981,9.040432301

VU University Amsterdam was the first university in the Netherlands established by a private person, with no interference from the church or the state. This heritage is still very much part of who we are: VU stands for Vrije Universiteit, which translates literally as 'Free University.' This name expressly states our independence: we are free of the state, the church or any commercial interests.However, science and academic pursuit can never be free of values, and values are always based on some form of conviction or philosophy. VU University attaches great value to different convictions, distinguishing itself from other universities by its willingness to open them to discussion. Since its foundation in 1880, the university has sought to maintain a link between academic pursuit on the one hand and the Christian conviction on the other. In recent decades we have engaged in open dialogue with other faiths and ethical systems. VU University Amsterdam has a strong sense of social engagement. It is an academic community which attaches importance to openness and which maintains a strong international outlook. It is a university which pursues innovation and progress, and which is able to take full advantage of the diversity of disciplines, nationalities and convictions on its campus. Through its research, VU University wishes to make a significant contribution in solving the major societal issues of our age. Another, equally important, objective is to help young people develop to become astute academics who, based on a strong sense of social engagement, are able to fill important positions in the international and intercultural society of the future. Accordingly, the university places a strong emphasis on the broad academic education of its students, informed by its traditional core values. Education and research are directly interlinked. The university offers education in those areas in which it has a strong reputation for research and in which there is a high demand for qualified professionals.VU University has formulated three core values which have a direct relationship with the institution’s Christian ethos: •Responsible: working in the service of man and society.•Open: diversity as a source of inspiration and innovation.•Personally engaged: an academic community in which every member is fully acknowledged.The ‘Vision for VU 2025’ sets out the situation in which the university wishes to find itself in 2025. In 2025, VU University will be notable:•as a strong research university, performing leading international research which makes a real contribution towards solving major societal issues.•by means of an (inter)nationally competitive range of graduate research and academic programmes.•as a scientific and academic educational institute serving the greater Amsterdam region. VU University provides good and well organized education to those with academic pre-qualifications (the VWO school diploma), helping them develop into critical and socially engaged academics.•by virtue of its unique character. The three core values will inspire and inform all education and research, and will be reflected in the day-to-day interaction between staff and students.To enhance the visibility of the university for students, researchers, granting organizations, public and private sector partners and others, VU University is to structure its education and research within four key themes:1.Human Health and Life Sciences, 2. Science for Sustainability, 3. Connected World, and 4. Governance for Society.",30822,14.7,18312,13.3,12510,16.8,52.33396225,4.865196501

The first president was Shidehara Tan Tairaka Hiroshi. In 1945, the Republic of China won the war of resistance against Japan, and Taiwan was handed over to the Nationalist government of China. On November 15 of that year, Taihoku Imperial University was formally transferred to Chinese administration and renamed as National Taiwan University, with Dr. Tsung-lo Lo appointed as the first President._x000D_
During the Japanese occupation, the University consisted of two academic divisions: the Literature and Politics division and the Science and Agriculture division, with about 60 students enrolled each semester. The Medical division was added in 1936, followed by the Engineering division in 1943. Additionally, the University included the affiliated Agriculture and Forestry division, the affiliated Medical special division, a Tropical Medicine research institute and a preparatory school. Also, in 1943 the Southern Humanities research institute and the Southern Resource research institute were added. At that time, each division operated according to the lecture system, with a full-time Professor in charge of a faculty of associate professors, lecturers, teaching assistants and staff. These divisions and institutes were financially independent and had their own libraries. By 1945, the university expanded to five divisions, including Literature and Politics, Science, Agriculture, Medicine and Engineering, with a total enrollment of 382 students._x000D_
After restructuring in accordance with the ROC academic system in 1945, academic departments were established and the former divisions were renamed Colleges. The Literature and Politics division was divided into the College of Liberal Arts and the College of Law. Additionally, colleges of Science, Medicine, Engineering and Agriculture were established. Initially, there were six colleges with 22 departments. In 1945, student enrollment was 585. In the following years, the departments and colleges expanded in faculty and hardware in step with growing budgets and rising social expectations. In 1960, the night school was initiated on a trial basis, and in 1967 a new night school was established. In 1987, the College of Management was established, followed by the College of Public Health in 1993 and the College of Electrical Engineering in 1997. The College of Electrical Engineering was later rechristened the College of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering; in 1999, the College of Law was renamed the College of Social Sciences, and the Night Division and the Center for Continuing Education were combined to form the School for Professional and Continuing Studies. In 2002, the College of Agriculture was renamed the College of Bio-resources and Agriculture, and in 2002 a College of Life Sciences was added. Now, the university has 11 colleges, with 54 departments and 108 graduate institutes, plus over 50 national and university-level research centers. The total number of students, including those enrolled at the School of Professional and Continuing Studies, has grown to over 32,000, including over 17,000 university students and 15,000 graduate students.

Alma Mater Studiorum: the first university in the Western world_x000D_
The University of Bologna has ancient origins, and is considered to be the oldest university in the Western world. 1088 is the year in which by convention the University of Bologna is considered to have been founded, when law began to be taught freely in the city. Founded by students and for students, the Alma Mater Studiorum immediately attracted young scholars from all over Europe, bringing to life the ideal of the universality of knowledge and culture it still pursues today, also through its increasing focus on internationalisation._x000D_
The University of Bologna was home to illustrious students including Petrarca, Boccaccio and Dante Alighieri, and a laboratory for many famous academics studying in its different schools - from law to medicine, from the arts and philosophy to mathematics and science. Over the centuries it has developed to carve out and maintain a central role in forging knowledge for the society of the future. The University's key role in world culture was confirmed in 1988, on its nine hundredth anniversary, when the Rectors from 430 universities from every continent met in Bologna to undersign the Magna Charta Universitatum Europaeum, formally recognising the University of Bologna as the Alma Mater of all universities. The Magna Charta, currently signed by 752 Rectors from 81 countries, underlines the autonomy of universities and the essential link between teaching and research, transcending the limits imposed by “any geographical and political border”. Again, in 1999, in the University's Aula Magna, 29 European Ministers of higher education signed the Bologna Declaration which led to the start of an important – and ongoing - process to build the European Higher Education Area. The aim is to promote European Higher Education throughout the world, increasing competitiveness and international collaboration._x000D_
Today the Alma Mater is an autonomous, non-denominational, pluralistic public institution whose primary aims are research and teaching, indissoluble activities which pursue critical knowledge that is open to dialogue and interaction among cultures, respecting the freedom of science and teaching. The Alma Mater sets out to be a natural environment for knowledge, interpreting and orienting the transformations of its time, guaranteeing the processing, innovation, transfer and enhancement of knowledge for the advantage of both individuals and society as a whole._x000D_
Values and Future_x000D_
Freedom, merit, excellence, internationalisation_x000D_
The University of Bologna promotes and safeguards the respect for basic human rights, a primary value for the whole university community. The recognition of merit and the pursuit of excellence are priority criteria that guide the development strategies and choices of the Alma Mater._x000D_
Students enrolling at the University of Bologna have a wide range of choices, in terms of both study programmes and the choice of university campus. The Alma Mater has been a multicampus university since 1989, the Bologna campus working together with other campuses in Cesena, Forlì, Ravenna and Rimini. Each campus is an integral part of its host city, offering facilities and services which accompany students throughout their university life, not only in their studies but also in cultural activities, sports and other forms of associations._x000D_
The quality of teaching is closely linked to the quality of research, and research plays a key role in the future of new generations and society generally. This profound belief underlies all the activities of the Alma Mater, which also include the skilful sourcing and use of national and international funds and the creation of strategic alliances with both institutions and the business world._x000D_
At the University of Bologna, internationalisation has been considered a strategic tool for many years. Its international dimension lies in both its history and its vocation: the inauguration of the Studies Center in Buenos Aires in 1998 and, more generally, the opening of research and learning programmes to foreign countries, the establishment of and participation in international networks and consortia, both incoming and outgoing mobility for students and scholars (which places it at the top of the European league tables), demonstrate the University's ability to dialogue with the most qualified international scientific and cultural institutions._x000D_
The Alma Mater places great attention on its organisation and works to assure the constant improvement of its processes, welcoming the challenge of combining large numbers with quality._x000D_
A long-standing promoter of relations with civil society, the institutions and businesses, and a driving force in the economic and cultural growth of the territory it operates in, the University actively contributes to the well-being of society and the increased competitive performance of the production system of the whole country._x000D_
Teaching_x000D_
Quality by vocation_x000D_
The Alma Mater is a place where knowledge is processed, transmitted and learned. An educational vocation which, since its foundations, has led to the definition of learning pathways focusing on the acquisition of critical skills and methodological rigour using a multitude of methods and disciplines._x000D_
Today the University offers a wide and diversified, cosmopolitan and rigorous range of study programmes designed to promote students' personal, cultural and professional growth, through the transfer of the results of its research, also meeting the demands of a complex, open society._x000D_
More than 2,800 professors work with more than 87,000 students fromItalyand other countries: a community working together on degree programmes, first and second level Professional Master's, PhDs, specialisation schools, post-graduate and lifelong learning programmes and summer and winter schools._x000D_
Internationalisation is a quality feature of all teaching programmes at the Alma Mater, contributing to the promotion of positive encounters of people and ideas from all kinds of geographical origins and cultural backgrounds: of the more than 440 study opportunities, 49 are international programmes._x000D_
Teaching at the University of Bologna is supported by numerous international agreements: 169 bilateral and multilateral cooperation framework agreements signed with partner universities (mostly from outside of the EU), 214 specific (sectoral) cooperation agreements with partner universities at faculty or department level, 1,986 bilateral agreements with foreign universities under the Erasmus programme._x000D_
The quality of the University's Programme Catalogue, which is constantly monitored through student assessments, places Bologna among the top Italian universities in the national and international league tables. The Alma Mater is top of the 2010-2011 table drawn up by Censis-Repubblica and is the top-ranking Italian university in the world tables drawn up by QS World Ranking._x000D_
Students_x000D_
At the heart of the Alma Mater system_x000D_
The University of Bologna offers students a wide range of services to support and facilitate their entire study path and their overall personal growth throughout their university career._x000D_
For the Alma Mater, the right to study is a priority, and is guaranteed by actions offering financial support and incentives for merit-worthy students without their own means: these include the total or partial exemption from tuition fees, scholarships for studying in Italy and abroad, loans, collaborations within the university organisation, merit prizes and a range of other services dedicated to the students of the Alma Mater._x000D_
Students lie at the heart of the University organisation. Incoming, information and guidance services aim to promote the aware choice of study programmes, the regularity of university careers and a reduction in the number of drop-outs. Through computerised, flexible procedures accessible from different platforms, students at the Alma Mater are able to communicate easily with the university community, organising and managing their own study paths directly online. Accommodation, canteens, study facilities, libraries, health care and an office for the registration of rental contracts are available for students living outside the city. Every campus provides specific services for disabled and dyslexic students as well as psychological support services._x000D_
The University invests in a wide range of sports and language services, signing agreements with institutions in the city for subsidised cultural initiatives for students, and supports the activities of the student associations._x000D_
The focus on the needs of students as people, citizens and future professionals, as well as the creation, management and continuous monitoring of dedicated student services, as well as the quality of the teaching, have made the University of Bologna one of the most popular and well-attended in Italy, the most international of Italian universities, with efficiency indexes above the national average, and a valid, authoritative interlocutor for businesses and institutions, also for training courses and internships._x000D_
To facilitate entry into the labour market, the University has signed agreements with around 8,000 public and private businesses and institutions, around 100 of which are abroad. Finally, the success of the careers guidance policies is confirmed by the percentage of graduates, around 50%, who one year after completing their studies are in paid employment._x000D_
Research_x000D_
Investing in young people for the common good_x000D_

The University of Cincinnati is ranked among the Top Tier of the country's ""Best National Universities"" according to U.S. News. UC rose to 139th in the latest ranking – up from 156th in 2010. The 17-point move in two years puts UC's ranking at the same level as Arizona State, George Mason and Oregon State. UC has numerous programs ranked among the top 100 public universities in the nation. Of the UC programs that are nationally ranked, 34place in the top 50._x000D_
The Chronicle of Higher Education calls UC a “research heavy weight.” Forbes magazine, Delta Sky and Travel+Liesure magazine have named UC one of the world’s most beautiful campuses. UC has been named a “green university” by Princeton Review, which also ranked UC among the top 20 universities in the nation for the diversity of the student population. G.I.

The University of Cincinnati earned an A+ from Intead, an international student marketing company that conducted a “secret shopper” test, posing as an international student seeking information to begin fall 2014studies. In this responsiveness test, which included universities from the United States, Canada and Australia, UC was rated No. 1 for its impressive response._x000D_
In the International Student Barometer survey of 193 universities, UC ranked eighth in the world. The survey asks student opinion about their experiences in categories ranging from student learning to student life and social activities; support services (career advising, counseling, IT support); and experience on arrival (orientation services, registration)._x000D_
The University of Cincinnati leads the world in Cooperative Education, which for more than 100 years has provided students with the opportunity to alternate full-time terms of school and work to provide them with a solid base of experience and professional development. In recent years, UC launched the Academic Internship Program, which provides access to opportunities for part-time internships and the Center for Service Learning and Civic Engagement to supporting campus-community connections. Germany and Japan have been the traditional international co-op destinations since international co-op began as a formal offering in 1990, and those placements have held steady in recent years. However, recently, co-op placements in China have been increasing dramatically. China is now the second-largest international destination for UC co-op students.  InFY13, UC began the Singapore Experience, allowing UC co-op and internship students to live and work in Singapore to gain experience in and exposure to Asia, home to 60 percent of the world’s population._x000D_
The University of Cincinnati traces its origins to 1819when, due to the tireless energy of Daniel Drake – physician, scholar, teacher, and lecturer – the State of Ohio chartered both the Cincinnati College and the Medical College of Ohio. These pioneer institutions endure today as UC’s colleges of law and medicine._x000D_
Despite ambitious beginnings, scarce funds and internal friction handicapped both institutions and they fell into inactivity. In 1835, the Cincinnati College was revived under President William Holmes McGuffey, author of the famous McGuffey Readers. Again, financial trouble and the effects of the Civil War prevented the institution from achieving success. Only the college’s Law School survived._x000D_
In 1858, a wealthy merchant and landowner named Charles McMicken bequeathed his estate to Cincinnati for the creation of a municipal university. This gift provided the foundation of the University of Cincinnati, chartered in 1870 by the Ohio General Assembly._x000D_
During the next century, a number of Cincinnati educational institutions were merged with the University of Cincinnati, including the colleges of medicine, law and pharmacy. Also merging were the esteemed College-Conservatory of Music, the Ohio Mechanics Institute, and the Cincinnati Observatory. Over the course of its first century, UC founded colleges of engineering, business, education, nursing, and art. The university has awarded graduate degrees since 1878._x000D_
By the mid 1960s, it was apparent that the resources of the City of Cincinnati could not be stretched to accommodate the rapidly growing student body and an aging physical plant. The citizens of Cincinnati voted overwhelmingly to convert their university to full state status, and UC was named Ohio's 12th state university on July 1, 1977._x000D_
The University of Cincinnati has established a continuing reputation for academic accomplishment and innovative ideas. Since its founding, UC has been the source of many contributions to society, including the oral polio vaccine, the first program of cooperative education, the first electronic organ, the first safe anti-knock gasoline, and the first antihistamine._x000D_

Research in medicine and the environmental and biological sciences are particularly strong at UEA.  And the relatively new School of Pharmacy has quickly established itself as being one of the best in the country.  But the University is also very widely known for the humanities, particularly creative writing, with many prize-winning leading contemporary authors among its alumni, including Kazuo Ishiguro, Ian McEwan, Rose Tremain and Tracy Chevalier. The University was recently awarded a Queen’s Prize for Higher Education for its research and hands-on work in International Development. All academics in this field are expected to act as practitioners and consultants and can be found working and assessing development projects across the globe. Other social science schools are also well regarded.  Social Work, Law and business courses, for example, are also popular at the University, which is known for the excellence of its teaching as well as for its world-class research. There has been a good deal of investment in the University’s facilities in recent years. The Business School, for example, moved last year into a new purpose-built centre, equipped with the very latest audio-visual and computer technology, a resource centre and a Board Room and other rooms that simulate a business environment.  The University Library has been extended and refurbished for this academic year. Centrally located at the heart of the campus, the Library is open seven days a week and until midnight on six nights a week, during semesters. It incorporates a 24-hour IT area and a wireless network for laptop users and adds over 15,000 new titles to its stocks of books and journals every year. Accommodation on the University campus is of very high quality and international undergraduates who apply in time are guaranteed a room for the duration of their course. In recent years, the University has built a number of new residences and has also refurbished its award-winning older residences and its cafes and restaurants. The distinctive campus was designed so that everything you need for living and studying is no more than a few minutes away. Students do not have to leave the attractive campus to enjoy superb social and cultural facilities. The Sportspark is the biggest of any UK university, offering an Olympic swimming pool, climbing wall, courts for squash and badminton, football pitches, tennis courts, an athletics track and a wide range of exercise and dance classes.

Though the University was founded in Lorraine in 1572, the fusion that took place in 2012 created a hub of scientific advancement, economical growth and knowledge transfer._x000D_
60,000 students, 6,900 staff members, 43 teaching departments and 60 research centers make the UL one of the largest universities in the country._x000D_
Campuses are situated throughout the region, each with their own focus. UL offers curricula in all fields of knowledge. A specific focus is given to cross-talk between fields and competences, in order to help students develop individualized career paths. The Lorraine region has been shaped since the 19th century by the mining and metallurgical industries, which fostered the development of education and research in engineering and technology. During the 20th century, this concept of engineering took on a broader meaning of global engineering, i.e. the ability to design, develop, validate and implement innovative solutions to global challenges, by relying on disciplinary excellence to address the basic scientific questions, and illuminating the connections between scientific domains and current economic and social challenges. UL thus positions itself as a multidisciplinary, technological and entrepreneurial university, able to develop comprehensive answers to the economic and societal challenges of the 21st century._x000D_

Early success led to its being named one of the nation’s 64 “key colleges and universities.” In 1975, the school was obliged to move to a new campus in Wuhan. In 1978, the graduate faculties relocated in Beijing under the support of Mr. Deng Xiaoping, the leader of the People’s Republic of China. In 1987, the Ministry of Education approved a plan for China University of Geosciences to develop two tertiary institutions in Beijing and Wuhan respectively, both of which have independent legal personalities. China University of Geosciences in Beijing is among the first group of China’s higher level universities designated for the state key construction of the “211” project and is one of the first 33 universities in China approved to set up graduate schools as well. In February 2000, China University of Geosciences in Beijing (heretofore “CUGB”), previously managed by the Ministry of Land and Resources, was put under the management of the Ministry of Education. In March 2005, CUGB and China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) became independent educational entities. Finally, in September 2006, CUGB was established as a joint responsibility of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Land and Resources._x000D_
Since its foundation in 1952, China University of Geosciences in Beijing has experienced an unusual course of development: creation, expansion, re-location, reconstruction, and revitalization. CUGB has produced a large cohort of graduates equipped with the technical knowledge and professional attitudes needed to build up the nation and contribute to the flourishing of the earth sciences._x000D_
At present, the university boasts nine members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences on its staff. Out of 40,000+ graduates, 24 alumni have been elected to either the Chinese Academy of Sciences or the Chinese Academy of Engineering, and more than 200 alumni have been singled out as “model workers” by provinces or ministries._x000D_
As a multi-disciplinary national key university, CUGB is one of China’s main centers for educating geological researchers and professionals of all sorts. It has evolved an educational program that balances sciences, technology, arts, management, economics and law—one which emphasizes a connection between education and geology, natural resources, environment and geological engineering. CUGB has 17 colleges with a total of 47 undergraduate programs and 118 graduate programs for a master’s degree, 37 doctoral programs, 16 fields of Master of Engineering, and 9 post-doctoral research stations. At present there are 14,000 full-time students, 25000 continuing education students, 12000 independent college students enrolled with a teaching and research staff comprised of 1200. CUGB is headed by Mr. Wang Hongbing, the chairman of the university council and Prof. Deng Jun, president of the university._x000D_
During its 50 years of practice, China University of Geosciences in Beijing has developed its glorious motto of “work hard, keep modest, and pursue truth and pragmatism”. Guided by the principle of scientific development, CUGB attempts to accomplish the following: it embraces a philosophy of “special and best;” it earnestly carries out the Party's policy on education; it perseveres in the socialist orientation in education provision; and CUGB cultivates innovative graduates with “good moral, sound background, wide knowledge, high profession.” The university is going forward to become a first-class international university in the field of geosciences.",17361,1.1,8300,0.6,7376,1.9,39.9886573,116.3406423

James Cook University was established to conduct teaching and research on areas of importance to North Queensland and the tropics world-wide.  Our focus is on producing graduates who have the expertise and intellectual curiosity to make a difference in their profession and their communities and conducting the research needed to meet the challenges facing the tropical world.  We are also committed to producing the professional workforce for under-served communities and providing access and opportunity to those who may not have previously been able to access higher education. Started in 1960 in Townsville as a University College of The University of Queensland and established as a university in 1970, James Cook University has since expanded into a multi-campus institution with the largest campuses located in Townsville and Cairns. Our footprint now extends beyond northern Queensland to include our Singapore Campus which combines research and teaching and demonstrates our commitment to the Asian region and internationalisation, particularly in the tropics. JCU also has a presence in Brisbane by means of a campus operated by Russo Higher Education. At JCU staff and students benefit from our tropical location to conduct at or above world standard research in the following areas: environmental science and management; fisheries sciences; geochemistry, geology, evolutionary biology, plant biology, zoology; tourism; inorganic chemistry, oceanography; physical geography and environmental geoscience; biochemistry and cell biology; genetics; materials engineering; immunology; neurosciences; nursing; specialist studies in education; anthropology; human geography; linguistics; and historical studies. The University is rated in the top 4% of universities in the world in the Academic Ranking of World Universities (Also known as the Shanghai Jiao Tong World Rankings), an achievement equaled/surpassed by only two other Queensland Universities. We recognise that the University is judged not only on its quality but equally on its relevance and impact beyond academia. Accordingly we commit ourselves to research of excellence and high impact, particularly on issues of critical importance to the world’s tropics. We recognise our obligation to engage with industry and government, commercialise our research findings and achieve critical mass through productive research partnerships with other research organisations. JCU is a site and catalyst for innovation and understanding. Our teaching is high-quality, innovative and engaging to students. Our approach is characterised by personal contact with students and we provide alternate modes of delivery responsive to their needs, in a contemporary learning environment, ensuring contact with teachers and other students. JCU is a contemporary and dynamic institution and a major driver of economic growth and social change in northern Queensland, as well as having international impact and reach. JCU recognises its “power of place” and engages with all its communities and industry to promote a sustainable region that is socially inclusive. As northern Queensland is a site for a first and second roll-out of the National Broadband network, JCU will work with the Government to maximize the opportunities that the NBN presents to reduce the disadvantage of distance and provide opportunities for students to access education and resources._x000D_

Its predecessor was a Higher School founded in 1808 that in 1838 became a Lyceum. In 1905, by a special decree of the then Serbian Government, the Lyceum became the University of Belgrade. It started its institutional life with three schools – philosophy, law and engineering. The fact which speaks most about the significance of the University of Belgrade in the Balkans is that all state universities in Serbia and several universities in the region were founded by the University of Belgrade, while private universities in Serbia were founded by the teaching staff educated at the University of Belgrade. Nowadays, the University of Belgrade consists of 31 schools, 11 research institutes, and 8 centers in the fields of vital importance to the functioning of the University, such as: career development, technology transfer, quality assurance, strategic management and planning, work with physically challenged students and Computer Center. The University Library “Svetozar Marković”, with more than 3,500.000 volumes, is also a member of the University. The University disposes of 11 endowments provided by affluent citizens of Serbia and 7 funds for supporting 200 best students of the University of Belgrade. On the occasion of celebrating 200 years of existence of the University of Belgrade and higher education in Serbia, the organization of former students of the University of Belgrade – Alumni of the University of Belgrade – was founded in 2008. Besides connecting former students of the University, this organization aims to contribute to the promotion of quality of studies at the University of Belgrade. The University of  Belgrade provides training in traditional and some new emerging disciplines. Its schools are divided into four groups, according to the disciplines they teach: - Sciences and Mathematics- Technology and Engineering Sciences- Medical Sciences- Social Sciences and Humanities. As the largest learning community in this part of Europe, with 432 study programs, of which: 172 undergraduate, 194 master, 66 doctoral studies (with 712 succesfully defended doctoral theses), 94,458 students (of which 4,171 international) and 6,174 academic and research staff, 3,105 papers on SCIE and SSCI lists, numerous publications and scientific and research projects, the University of Belgrade has unique responsibilities and opportunities toward the society. One of its most important roles is to help development of the society through the affirmation and promotion of education and creation of new intellectual partnerships within the University, as well as within the society as a whole. Therefore, it has a very long tradition in academic and cultural exchange, as well as inter-university and international cooperation with universities within the country and abroad. The University of Belgrade has also a great experience in cooperation with international organizations focusing on higher education. This is clearly shown by the bilateral agreements of cooperation concluded with more than 180 universities on every continent, membership in the European University Association (EUA), the Network of Universities from the Capitals of Europe (UNICA), the Black Sea Universities Network (BSUN), the Danube Rectors' Conference (DRC), the University Network of the Adriatic and Ionian Basin (UNIADRION), Association des Universites Francophones (AUF) and others. Students of the University of Belgrade are members of numerous international organizations: Board of European Students of Technology (BEST), Electrical Engineering Students European Association (EESTEC), Association Internationale des Etudiants en Sciences Economiques et Commerciales (AIESEC), European Students of Industrial Engineering and Management (ESTIEM), Association des Etats Généraux des Etudiants de l’Europe (AEGEE), Center for Student International Cooperation (CMSS), European Law Students' Association (ELSA) and South Eastern European Youth Network (SEEYN) and many more. The University also maintains contacts with rectors' conferences in individual countries, with academic associations and teacher and student exchange associations. In addition, the Rector of the University of Belgrade is the President of Conference of Universities of Serbia, which consists of 17 accredited state and private universities. In 2008, the University of Belgrade became an active partner in the ERASMUS MUNDUS cooperation scheme that provides opportunities for academic mobility from the Western Balkans to the EU and vice-versa. The University of Belgrade takes active part in European programs as a grantholder and partner in many projects (Horizon 2020, Erasmus+, TEMPUS, FP7, CIP, LLP, Erasmus Mundus, EUREKA, COST, IPA etc.). Academic Artistic Associations of the University  of Belgrade, ‘Branko Krsmanović’ and ‘Španac’, also play an active role in students’ life, helping them express their artistic talents in the area of performing arts. Students of the University of  Belgrade are very active in the field of sports. This is illustrated by the fact that they have won numerous medals on Summer and Winter Universiades, and one of them – the 25th Summer Universiade – was hosted by the University of Belgrade. During the two centuries of its existence the University of Belgrade has served its people, and its former students and teachers have greatly contributed towards the development of cultural, scientific, educational, political and economical life of our country. The University of Belgrade is prepared to maintain and improve its position as the leading higher education institution both in the country and in the region. The University is striving to preserve what is worthy in its tradition and what makes it recognizable as a national brand, but has also expressed its readiness to adapt to the challenges of the present day. Having signed the Bologna Declaration, the University of  Belgrade has shown its commitment to joining European Higher Education Area in the nearest future.

Its distinctive capabilities have contributed to the global research and development agenda through leading-edge scholarship and have produced global citizens who are passionate about intellectual and social engagement.  Wits’ academic and research excellence has grown from strength to strength since this University acquired its full status as a university in 1922.  We aim to build on this reputation aggressively by intensifying our efforts to create an environment conducive to elevating the standard and impact of research, quality of teaching and learning, and the rigour of intellectual and social engagement, to new heights. The University of the Witwatersrand is an urban university located in the heart of a populous, vibrant but also complex metropolitan city, an interconnected economic and physical space now officially known as the Gauteng City Region (GCR). Wits has a strong history of achievements that distinguish it in many ways from other universities in South Africa. These realities include the following: 1. Wits has a very high proportion of its enrolments in the Science, Engineering and Technology disciplines, including high levels of Masters and Doctoral students; 2. Wits’ strength in postgraduate education is reflected in the fact that one-third of our students study at this level. Importantly, a quarter of these are international students who have been attracted to postgraduate study at Wits; 3. The high quality of Wits graduates is reflected in the fact that 90% of graduates that the University produces get permanent employment within 12 months of graduation (excluding those opting to pursue further studies or not to seek employment); 4. Wits’ powerful research track record is reflected, in part, in the 23 fields of study where the University ranks favourably in the world. We have shown especially strong growth in both the engineering and social science fields, signalling the breadth and balance of our disciplinary excellence. Further, our publication record shows a very high level of international collaboration: a substantial percentage (44.8%) of all papers published by Wits academics in International Science Index (ISI) journals have at least one international co-author; 5. Wits’ professional disciplines remain leaders in the country, producing graduates who are in demand globally. Wits continues to offer high-quality education in these disciplines, which cut across all faculties, putting emphasis on engineering, health sciences, commerce, law and some areas in the social sciences and the humanities; 6. The strength of Wits in the science and engineering disciplines has, over the years, created a strong culture of innovation and the creation of support structures for the commercialisation of ideas and research results. This, together with the activities of the Learning Information and Knowledge (LINK) Centre on ICT policy, regulation and management, and the more recently established Centre for Entrepreneurship and the teaching and research programmes on Strategic Management of Innovation, both in the Wits Business School (WBS), have considerably elevated Wits’ standing as a university of relevance in the “knowledge economy”; 7. Rapid urbanisation and growth of the city and the city region of Gauteng have created a slew of unique opportunities of engagement in a variety of other fields that have been and are being pursued with vigour by our academics. Strong examples include the Gauteng City Region Observatory (GCRO) and the Johannesburg Centre for Software Engineering (JCSE). Strong research and policy advice is provided by (among many others) the Forced Migration Studies Programme, at the Centre for Urbanism and Built Environment Studies (CUBES), and the Sociology of Work Project (SWOP); 8. Wits’ long-acknowledged leading position in the health sciences is augmented by its strong foothold in a typical vulnerable rural setting at Agincourt in Mpumalanga, where ongoing research on the ‘quadruple burden of disease’, coupled with the availability of extensive longitudinal datasets, provides unique opportunities for cutting-edge research into comparative studies in urban and rural settings, particularly if seen in conjunction with the activities of the Perinatal HIV Research Unit at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, which is one of the largest AIDS research centres in Africa, the Birth to Twenty programme and the Heart of Soweto study; 9. Wits has a strong tradition of public intellectual debate. Through its Distinguished Scholars Programme, Wits continues to attract internationally renowned scientists and Nobel Laureates from around the world to participate in scholarly activities of the University; and 10. In the past five years Wits has repeatedly been ranked as one of the top 500 of approximately 20 000 universities in the world. This attests to Wits’ existing internal capacity and the reality of its ability to produce research with high international impact and to offer high-quality education.",27586,5.9,23597,4.8,3989,12.1,-26.1888766,28.0247912

History_x000D_
UFRGS’s history started with the foundation of the School of Pharmacy and Chemistry, in 1895, and, soon after, the School of Engineering. That was also the start of higher education in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Still in the 19th century, Porto Alegre’s Faculty of Medicine and Faculty of Law were founded, what, in 1900, marked the beginning of humanitarian courses in the state. But it was only on November 28th, 1934, that Universidade de Porto Alegre was created, initially merging the School of Engineering, with the Astronomy, Power Engineering, and Industrial Chemistry Institutes; the Faculty of Medicine, with the School of Dentistry and Pharmacy; the Faculty of Law, with its School of Commerce; the Faculty of Agronomy and Veterinary Medicine; the Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences, and Humanities; and by the Fine Arts Institute. The third great moment of transformation of this university took place in 1947, when it started to be designated Universidade do Rio Grande do Sul, or URGS, incorporating the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Dentistry from Pelotas, and the Faculty of Pharmacy from Santa Maria. In December 1950, the University was federalized, being shifted to the Union’s administrative sphere. Since then, UFRGS – Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, started to stand out in the national scenery, as one of the largest budgets in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, and as number one in publications and number two in scientific production, among federal universities, taking into consideration the number of teachers._x000D_

The university has as its objective to form qualified human resources, with scientific and technological abilities, and who are committed to the exercise of citizenship. UFRGS, community of teachers, students and technical administrative staff, has as main goal higher education, and the production of philosophical, scientific, and technological knowledge, integrated with education, research and extension._x000D_
UFRGS, as public University, is the expression of a democratic and multicultural society, inspired by the ideals of freedom, respect to differences, and solidarity, constituting a necessary instance of critical conscience in which the community can reflect about their way of life, and their social, economic, and political organization. UFRGS is a centenary institution nationally and internationally recognized. It offers courses in all areas of knowledge and in all levels.

Precisely because ofthe social and political relevance of the issues dealt with, the independenceof the academic research and the associated freedom in terms of choice ofresearch topics and methodologies and publication of results are essential._x000D_
Identity, tradition andcontinuity must be maintained and shaped, whilst also making use of theinnovative potential of the members of the university and accelerating itsimplementation. One of the central tasks of the BOKU is to train, on the basisof its own research, a new generation of academics that can contribute in aqualified and critical way to both the technical/scientific andsocioscientific/economic discourse and help to shape future developments._x000D_
BOKU is committed topromoting gender equality and the integration of people with special needsbeyond the minimum statutory requirements by creating an appropriate workingenvironment. In general, BOKU is committed to measures that sustainably promoteand improve the well-being, satisfaction and health of the staff and students. Inits research, teaching and service provision, BOKU seeks to perform above theaverage. The quality of work is thus of great importance in all areas. Thequality assurance process is now based on international standards. The understandingof the importance of quality management is demonstrated by its integration intothe institution._x000D_
In addition to itsresearch, teaching and service-provision activities, BOKU sees its social rolein the active promotion and development of the values of democracy and the ruleof law. This involves placing particular emphasis on openness to the new,permitting diversity of opinion and actively promoting, both within theuniversity and in the outside world, interaction with other cultures in anon-prejudiced way. BOKU also involves itself in a responsible way in thepublic debate about social problems and their sustainable solutions. In orderto fulfil its tasks, BOKU cooperates with key academic, economic, political andsocial actors both within and outside Austria. With this mission, BOKU lives upto the new role of universities required on the European level in a “Europe ofknowledge”. This covers the full spectrum from knowledge acquisition, knowledgetransfer and dissemination to knowledge application. BOKU seeks to develop and secure Vienna’s andAustria’s positions by increasing its own access and possibilities withinresearch and teaching cooperation._x000D_
The unique position ofthe University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna is a result of itshistorical development: founded as a college of agriculture and forestry, BOKUis today still Austria's only university to deal in depth in its research andteaching with the sustainability and future use of natural resources and ourenvironment. Furthermore, it stands out for its structure, which is problemsolving - rather than subject-orientated. BOKU is thus the only institution inAustria which is in a position to deal comprehensively with entirevalue-creation chains (from production via consumption to disposal)._x000D_
Fundamental research ata high international level on the one hand and applied work focussing onregional issues on the other secures BOKU's role as the academic backbone ofAustrian primary production, in the widest sense of the term. Industrialisedand developing countries are both very interested in precisely thiscombination, which is demonstrated by the large number of cooperative projects withlocal and international companies, and projects in the field of developmentassistance._x000D_
Practical problem-solvingexpertise and excellent connections across Austria are the unique features ofBOKU, and result from its areas of concentration and the uniqueness of thecourses it offers. BOKU is one of the two universities in Austria to drawstudents from very far. This is because of the large number of students fromacross Austria and from abroad – both from developing countries and fromCentral Europe. The close cooperation with its alumni ensures a strongpractical component for BOKU subjects and courses.",12032,13.3,19561,10.1,7793,20.1,48.2527457,16.3690911

BJTU grew out of the Beijing Railway Management Institute, China’s first higher educational institute which was committed to fostering railway management talents and initiated modern China’s education in railway management and telecommunication._x000D_
BJTU has achieved distinction in offering a range of academic programs thanks to its development in over one hundred years. The university has been closely connected with the nation’s railway industry since its establishment. The faculty and students of BJTU have made great contributions to the growth of China’s railways, having participated in almost all the major events in different stages of development of the industry, from the movements for protecting railway rights and saving the nation in the 1900s to the great endeavor of building railways after the founding of the People’s Republic of China, from the massive industrial development movement in China’s southwest interior in the 1960s to the six railway speed-raising campaigns in recent years, from the completion of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway and the application of heavy-haul trains on the Datong-Qinhuangdao Railway to the building of high-speed railways and modern urban rail transit systems throughout the country in contemporary times. While improving its unique strength in such disciplines as Traffic and Transportation, Communications and Information, Economics and Management as well as Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, BJTU has fostered a strong sense of collaboration and innovation to improve its quality of education. The university has become an important base to turn out talents, especially outstanding talents in information technology and urban rail transit, for the economic and social development of China. It has also remained an influential institution which can help to solve significant technological and policy-making problems encountered in the development of the country’s economy, society and modern transportation systems._x000D_
BJTU has witnessed great changes since its founding. What remains unchanged is its emphasis on the principle of learning for practical application, meticulous scholarship, pursuit of innovation and practical and realistic work style. Inspired by these traditions, BJTU has maintained high academic standards and has been devoted to producing talents who can have both a firm footing in the basics and a strong sense of how the knowledge can be applied in the real world. The 10th Beijing Jiaotong University Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) was successfully held in April, 2012. BJTU has become a university administered and supported jointly by the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Railways and the Beijing People’s Municipal government since April 26, 2012 when an agreement was signed among the three parties. A plan for developing a new campus, an innovation center for rail transit as well, in Pinggu on the outskirts of Beijing has been conceived and gained strong support from the Ministry of Education and the local government. Sticking to its motto “to learn and to practice” and seizing the opportunities of development, BJTU has been steadily advancing toward its goal of building itself into a world-renowned university with high-level distinction in the mid-21st century.",30023,5.1,16520,5.5,13503,4.6,39.95044035,116.336069

Teachers from other academic institutions in Israel provided  higher education in Beer-Sheva. Continuous efforts to convince the government  to establish a full-fledged university in the Negev, in southern Israel, were  fruitful, and on November, 9, 1969, Yigal Alon, the Minister of Education and  acting Prime Minister, announced that the Government had decided to build and  support the “University of the Negev.” In November 1970, the first meeting of  the Board of Governors took place, and the “Institute for Higher Education in  the Negev” became the “University of the Negev.”_x000D_
The University was formally accredited by the Council for Higher Education  (CHE) in 1973 and after the death of David Ben-Gurion, Israel’s first and  legendary prime minister, it was officially named “Ben-Gurion University of  the Negev.”_x000D_
The University started to take shape on the Beit HIAS (a former hostel)  campus in Beer-Sheva during the early 1970s. It gradually came to include  faculties of Natural Sciences, Engineering Sciences, Humanities and Social  Sciences, Health Sciences, a Medical School, Institutes for Applied Research,  an Institute for Desert Research, and the Ben-Gurion of the Negev Heritage  Institute._x000D_

The past ten years have been marked by a rapid increase in the number of  students, from about 11,000 in 1995/6 to over 19,500 by 2011/2012. The  Kreitman School of Advanced Graduate Studies, which administers all PhD  studies, was established in 1997, and generous fellowships began to be  offered to outstanding PhD candidates and post-doctoral fellows. During that  period, new departments and study programs were added, among them the School  of Management (which has recently become The Guilford Glazer Faculty of  Business and Management), the Department of Middle East Studies, and the  Department of Politics and Government._x000D_
The University has five campuses: (a) three in Beer-Sheva: the Marcus  Family Campus (the main campus), the David Tuviyahu Campus (formerly Beit  HIAS) and the David Bergmann Campus, (b) one in Sede Boqer (south of  Beer-Sheva), which includes: the Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert  Research, the Albert Katz International School for Desert Research, and the  Ben-Gurion of the Negev  Research  Institute for the Study of Israel  and  Zionism, and (c) the University’s newest campus in Eilat, established in  2003.

Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology(MIPT) also known as“Phystech” is a young, dynamic and compact research university primarily focused on natural sciences and engineering. It has 3,300 undergraduate and 2,250 graduate students. Phystech was founded in 1951 as a public educational institution. Having the main campus at Moscow suburb «Dolgoprudny», MIPT is able to provide undergraduate students comfortable social environment for hard working toward undergraduate degrees. PhD and master degree students are conducting their research on the base of so-called ""sub-campuses"":_x000D_

Ranking_x000D_
Contemporaly world universities rankings are primarily based on citations and expert assessment reports. For a long time Phystech was closed for foreign visitors and the university never participated in international rankings. However, Phystech is regularly ranked as a leader among Russian research universities and as #2-#4 in all other national university rankings.  Domestically Phystech is called, sometimes, as «the Russian MIT»._x000D_
Phystech is known, mainly in the states of the former USSR, due to its unique  education - research model or ""Phystech system"". This system stars from the very selective admission process and very intensive 4-year bachelor programs enabling graduate students continue educational studies in research laboratories of Russian Ministers and the Academy of Sciences._x000D_
Graduate students’ research is conducted outside of the main Phystech campus, and, therefore, research publications ruttenly are not affiliated to Phystech at all. Such an external labled educational system hides MIPT from the academic radar (that was an advantage during the Cold War)._x000D_
Structure_x000D_
Phystech’s unique approach to education and training is supported by well-developed infrastructure that encompasses the main campus and 130 education-research units at major R&D and academic institutions across Moscow and the Moscow region. The university employs (part-time) best sholars to teach at these institutions, located not only in Moscow, but also at national scientific towns (Dubna, Troitsk, Chernogolovka, Fryazino, Pronvino, Puschino, Sarov, etc.)._x000D_

External funding raised for research rose between 2007 and 2012 by 77% and currently stands above 53 million Euros per year. The University of Rostock is among the ten most founder - friendly higher education establishments in Germany. The regional economy has benefitted from the over 800 start-up companies launched from the university since 1991. Young people from the West of Germany and increasing numbers of foreign students are discovering Rostock as a study location. Students from more than 90 countries can be found meanwhile on the four campus locations in the city. Since 1991 over 500 million Euros has been invested in the infrastructure of the university.

It is the oldest founded university in Spain and the fourth oldest European university, besides being considered the alma mater of Latin American universities, for their intense relationship at the beginning of higher education in Latin America. The University of Salamanca is of medium size made up of 9 teaching and administrative campuses offering 68 official degrees, and 25 double degrees in all branches of knowledge. It has around 25,000 registered undergraduate students. If we add to this figure the number of registered students in the 75 University Masters, 41 doctorate programmes and other studies, the figure is about 30,000 students. The University of Salamanca has always prided itself on its ability to attract students from outside of ""its natural market"". It is the second university in the country to attract a higher number of students from outside its region. This characteristic of the university has become more pronounced in recent years. Also worth noting is our capacity to attract foreign students from Europe and from the rest of the world. These figures are also rising steadily in our doctorate programmes where 14% of students are of European origin and 35% from the rest of the world, especially from Latin America. The University of Salamanca is the European university with the ninth largest number of incoming Erasmus students and ranks number five among Spanish Universities. However if we consider the importance of Erasmus students in relation to the size of our university, they represent 4.75% of the total number of students, this is in fact, the highest percentage among medium to large public universities. Each year, the University receives more than 10,000 foreign students, including those who come to learn Spanish, Erasmus students, and Graduate and Postgraduate students with a non-Spanish mother tongue, what makes the city internationally renowned for its university atmosphere. The academic institution main research fields of knowledge are Biosciences and Spanish courses for non-native speakers. In 2010, received the accreditation of Campus of International Excellence by the Ministry of Education for these areas. There are also other significant fields such as Art and Humanities, ICT, Mathematics, Physics, Geology, Law, Economy, Education or Psychology. The University of Salamanca has institutes and research groups in the field of the Biosciences that are European and global references in their area: The Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology of Cancer – Centre for Cancer Research (IBMCC-CIC) (www.cicancer.org) is particularly important owing to the leading international role of some of its teams and the acknowledgement it has received from other professionals, with several prestigious national and international awards. The Institute of Functional and Genomic Biology (IBFG) CSIC-University of Salamanca (www.imb.usal.es) has gained international recognition in the field of mycology. The Institute of Neurosciences of Castile and Leon – INCYL (www.incyl.usal.es) carries out important activities in national and international projects in the field of basic and applied neurosciences. The DNA Bank participates in the Human Genome Project, and is a worldwide recognized technological platform created to support biomedical research. In the area of agro-biotechnology, the Spanish-Portuguese Centre for Agricultural Research – CIALE (www.ciale.es) is carrying out research in agro-biotechnology, biodiversity, genetic improvement, plant production, plant health, etc. The Centre for Ultra-fast Ultra-intense Pulsed Lasers – CLPU (www.clpu.es) is a singular scientific infrastructure created as a consortium between the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitivity, the Regional Government of Castile and Leon and the University. One of the main assets of the University is the pursuit of excellence in the field of Spanish Language. In order to achieve this goal, the University builds on the collaboration of the most prestigious national and international teams and productions. There are many data that attest to this: It has more than 600 researchers in Spanish Language. The teaching of Spanish as a Foreign Language at the University of Salamanca began in 1929 and the Department of Spanish Language wrote the first communicative teaching manuals of the Spanish Language. Another force that drives the University is related to the assessment and certification of the Spanish Language. In this field, the University of Salamanca has researchers and teams of experts in the calibration and preparation of tests, the training of testers, and a team of more than 120 test markers, as well as technical staff and all the computer programmes and equipment required. In 1990, the University of Salamanca and the Spanish Ministry of Education signed a Cooperation Agreement that gave birth to the DELE certificates (Diploma of Spanish as a Foreign Language), official Spanish language exams. The “Instituto Cervantes” joined us in this task in 1992, after the establishment of agreements with the other two institutions. In 1990, the University of Salamanca and the University of Cambridge founded the Association of Language Testers in Europe (ALTE), a reference agency in Europe for the research, development and practice of examinations and tests in European languages. This association is currently made up of 31 members, representing 26 European languages. Since February 2008, the University of Salamanca has been part of the consortium controlling the project of indicators of Language Competences in the European Union (SURVEYLANG), together with the University of Cambridge, the Goethe-Institut, the Instituto Cervantes, CITO, the Alliance Française, the Università per Stranieri di Perugia and the Gallup Institute. The University of Salamanca is a member of the EPSO project (European Personnel Selection Office), which develops tests in 24 languages for the selection of translators for the European Union. The University of Salamanca together with the ""Instituto Cervantes"", the National Autonomous University of Mexico, and the University of Buenos Aires, has developed the first digital certificate of Spanish Language (SIELE) in the world. All these initiatives underscore the leading position of the University of Salamanca in the certification and assessment of the Spanish Language, together with its prospect of becoming a Campus of International Excellence._x000D_

Chartered in 1845 by the Republic of Texas and affiliated with the Baptist General Convention of Texas, Baylor is both the state's oldest institution of higher learning and the world's largest Baptist university. Established to be a servant of the church and of society, Baylor seeks to fulfill its calling through excellence in teaching and research, in scholarship and publication, and in service to the community, both local and global. The vision of its founders and the ongoing commitment of generations of students and scholars are reflected in the motto inscribed on the Baylor seal: Pro Ecclesia, Pro Texana — For Church, For Texas._x000D_
Pro Ecclesia. Baylor is founded on the belief that God's nature is made known through both revealed and discovered truth. Thus, the University derives its understanding of God, humanity and nature from many sources: the person and work of Jesus Christ, the biblical record, and Christian history and tradition, as well as scholarly and artistic endeavors. In its service to the Church, Baylor's pursuit of knowledge is strengthened by the conviction that truth has its ultimate source in God and by a Baptist heritage that champions religious liberty and freedom of conscience. Without imposing religious conformity, Baylor expects the members of its community to support its mission. Affirming the value of intellectually informed faith and religiously informed education, the University seeks to provide an environment that fosters spiritual maturity, strength of character and moral virtue._x000D_
Pro Texana. Integral to its commitment to God and to the church is Baylor's commitment to society. Whereas that society in the mid 1800s was limited to Texas, today Baylor's sphere of influence is indeed the world. The University remains dedicated to the traditional responsibilities of higher education — dissemination of knowledge, transmission of culture, search for new knowledge, and application of knowledge — while recognizing the global proportions these responsibilities have assumed. Moreover, within the context of an ethnically and culturally diverse community, Baylor strives to develop responsible citizens, educated leaders, dedicated scholars and skilled professionals who are sensitive to the needs of a pluralistic society. To those ends, Baylor provides expanded opportunities for civic education and for church and community service at home and abroad._x000D_
Pro Ecclesia, Pro Texana. Baylor University is committed to excellence at the undergraduate, graduate and professional levels. Within the undergraduate programs, the University seeks to familiarize students with the principal bodies of knowledge, cultural viewpoints, belief systems and aesthetic perspectives that affect the world in which they live. Within the graduate and the professional programs, the University provides advanced educational opportunities to develop ethical and capable scholars and practitioners who contribute to their academic disciplines, professional fields and society. Baylor encourages all of its students to cultivate their capacity to think critically, to assess information from a Christian perspective, to arrive at informed and reasoned conclusions, and to become lifelong learners. Beyond the intellectual life, the University pursues the social, physical, ethical and spiritual development of each student._x000D_
Aware of its responsibility as the largest Baptist educational institution in the world and as a member of the international community of higher learning, Baylor promotes exemplary teaching, encourages innovative and original research, and supports professional excellence in various specialized disciplines.

The University of Oviedo was founded in 1608 by Archbishop Fernando de Valdés Salas. Throughout its 400 years of history, the academic institution has been constantly growing and cementing its roots in the region.Since its foundation, the Historic Building (located in the city centre, where Arts, Law, and Theology were taught) hosts a historic and cultural legacy that has its turning point towards the end of the 19th century.At that time, the Group of Oviedo creates the Extensión Universitaria (University Extension), which would have a remarkable impact on the first decades of the 20th century._x000D_
The ‘OctoberRevolution’ in 1934 set a turning point in the history of the University, as the bibliography, many archives, and works of art were destroyed. After this event, a difficult period was started in order to recover more than 300 years of history. These efforts did not conclude until the 1940s._x000D_
Clearly, the 20th century is a foothold for the University and its integration in the regional territory. The academic needs run in parallel to the growth of the teaching institution: the University is provided with new buildings in Oviedo and also in other Asturian locations(Gijón and Mieres)._x000D_
In the second half of the last century the university keeps growing on the basis of the increase in the number of students. The degrees offered in Oviedo are taught in several campuses scattered in the city, whereas in Gijón and Mieres the new campuses have been specialized by offering courses on particular fields._x000D_
In November 2009, the University of Oviedo was awarded with the Campus of International Excellence, a public call promoted by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Science and Innovation in the framework of the Strategy 2015. This initiative was intended to improve the teaching and research quality of Spanish universities in order to place them in the best international rankings._x000D_
The University of Oviedo was awarded with the Campus of International Excellence with its project Ad Futurum. From the 17thto the 21stcentury: Looking Back,Looking Ahead. This proposal has been supported by the whole Asturian society, with more than 200 companies and institutions integrated in the project. The keystones of Ad Futurum are internationalization, talent acquisition, improving quality in teaching and research, promoting entrepreneurship, optimizing knowledge transfer and developing sustainable campuses that are environmentally-friendly and integrated in the territory. These objectives are intended to promote and stimulate the business sector in the region._x000D_
The University of Oviedo has adapted all its programmes to the European Higher Education Area (EHEA). In addition, it has started an organization process of its centres in order to group related degrees and promote a more efficient management. As long as internationalization is concerned, the academic institution has signed more than 30 agreements with foreign universities in the last year and it has opened new collaboration channels in the fields of teaching and research. To foster the international dimension of the institution and attract international students and lecturers,the University is aimed at promoting bilingualism in degrees and graduatecourses._x000D_
Our main goal is that the University of Oviedo improves its position in the international rankings, becoming an attractive institution for international students and lecturers at the same time it contributes to generate wealth by means of a more effective and optimized cooperation with the business sector.",20900,2.8,17533,1,3367,12.4,43.36170555,-5.846275133

Interdisciplinary - Communicative - Innovative - International_x000D_
Bielefeld University was founded in 1969 with an explicit research assignment and a mission to provide high-quality research-oriented teaching. Today it encompasses 14 faculties covering a broad spectrum of disciplines in the humanities, natural sciences, social sciences, and technology. With about 25,000 students in 118 degree courses and about 3,200 staff members (including 279 professors and lecturers as well as 1,800 academic staff) it is one of Germany's medium-sized universities._x000D_
Since its foundation, Bielefeld University has developed guided by the principle of interdisciplinarity. Behind this lies the conviction that complex problems can no longer be adequatety addressed with disciplinary approaches alone. In this case, interdisciplinarity stands for a spectrum of multiple perspective approaches of varying kinds and intensity. This perspective penetrates every aspect of the university’s identity. Even the University building itself stands as an architectural statement of interdisciplinarity. It brings together nearly all the facilities under one roof, which is unique in Germany. Its striking architectural structure draws people together from the most varied of areas over short distances._x000D_
At Bielefeld University, a culture of communication has developed between teaching staff and students, between scientists, university management and administrative staff, whose openness towards new and unconventional ideas is characteristic. This culture formed the basis of important forward-thinking decisions and has significantly contributed to the successes of the University. An example of this is the establishment of the Faculty of Technology (1990), as well as the Faculty of Health Sciences, which is itself singular in Germany. Both these faculties are evidence of the University’s institutional ability to innovate as the scope and demands of interdisciplinary evolves._x000D_
Springing from the Bielefeld principle of ‘Transcending Boundaries’, its research profile is interdisciplinary at its core, involving various faculties and central academic institutes – resulting in cutting-edge research carried out at the highest international level.The research profile of Bielefeld University is oriented to big issues relevant to science and society, primarily at the productive interfaces between disciplines.The support of researchers is paramount - exemplified by the world-renowned Centre for Interdisciplinary Research, which is one of the number of ways the university fosters academic talent - along with excellent infrastructure and a range of research and career development services.The University also distinguishes itself in its teaching through its specific profile that is based on dense networks across disciplines. According to the most relevant rankings and assessments, Bielefeld University Library is one of the best and most service-oriented university libraries in Germany._x000D_
In addition to interdisciplinarity, innovation and an overall commitment to excellence, diversity also plays a major role for the University, which is committed to inclusion, equality and opportunity for all with regard to gender, race, culture, sexuality, and/or disability. This is also evident in the central commitment to internationalization both to broaden the perspectives of all members of the student body and staff, both national and international, but also to create an environment where students and researchers from other countries, cultures and traditions feel comfortable and safe away from home. This is a commitment that is extended to its services for international students, researchers and employees at a multitude of levels with the goal to help create a home away from home, thus providing the proper context and environment where learning, study and research can be most productive for everyone.",25896,7,14584,5.5,11312,8.9,52.0280421,8.511479719

In 1956, the German Government offered technical assistance for establishing an institute of higher education in engineering in India. The first Indo-German agreement in Bonn, West Germany for the establishment of the Indian Institute of Technology at Madras was signed in 1959. IIT Madras embraces the broad mission objectives of the IITs, namely i) the advancement of knowledge through education and research, in both Pure and Applied Science, in Engineering, Social Science and Humanities, and ii) service to the community and nation through the use of their resources, both intellectual and material, particularly through Continuing Education for professionals working in industry. The stated vision of IITM is “to be an academic institution in dynamic equilibrium with its social, ecological and economic environment striving continuously for excellence in education, research and technological service to the nation.”_x000D_
IIT Madras’ stated mission is:_x000D_
To create and sustain a community of learning in which students acquire knowledge and learn to apply it professionally with due consideration for ethical, ecological, and economic issues. To pursue research and disseminate research findings. To provide knowledge-based technological services to satisfy the needs of society and the industry. To help in building national capabilities in science, technology, humanities, management, education and research. IIT Madras is a residential institute with nearly 570 faculty, 9000 students & research scholars and 700 administrative & supporting staff and is a self-contained campus located in a beautiful wooded land of about 250 hectares. It has established itself as a premier centre for teaching, research and industrial consultancy in the country. The Institute has 16 academic departments (11 in Engineering, 3 in the Sciences, 1 in Humanities & Social Sciences, and 1 in Management Studies), with nearly 100 laboratories organised in a unique pattern of functioning. In addition to traditional departmental research, IITM has initiated 16 interdisciplinary research centers. A faculty of international repute, a brilliant student community, excellent technical & supporting staff and an effective administration have all contributed to the pre-eminent status of IIT Madras._x000D_
Research at IIT Madras is nurtured through various academic programmes run by the departments and through sponsored programmes funded by national organizations and the industry._x000D_
Academic Research Programs_x000D_
These relate to research work undertaken by individual faculty or specific research groups in each department running academic programmes leading to M.S or Ph.D. degree. Research is carried out by scholars admitted to the programmes of study by research under the guidance of the faculty in each department. Areas of interest for each department are made known to the academic community through handbooks, brochures and bulletins. Topics of interest include the theoretical studies as well as experimental areas and there sources and facilities available in the different laboratories are used._x000D_
Sponsored Research_x000D_
Organization at the national level sponsor specific programs of research by funding projects undertaken by the faculty. Research of this kind is time bound but provides for those involved in the project to register for a degree. Project proposals are usually prepared by IIT faculty and forwarded to various organizations based on the nature of research and the interest shown by Govt/ Research bodies to fund new projects. Sponsored projects allow for new resources to be created in a department and often permit staff employed for the project to register for academic degrees in the institute. All Sponsored Research activities in the institute are coordinated by IC & SR._x000D_
Research based Industrial Consultancy_x000D_
Industrial Consultancy provides for faculty and staff of the institute to undertake specific assignments for the Industry, which may include project design, testing and evaluation or even training in new areas of industrial development. Industries and organizations involved in the industrial development request IIT faculty to take up specific assignments channelled through the Center for Industrial Consultancy and sponsored Research (ICSR). In addition to maintaining historical strengths as a top-tier educational institution, IITM’s key goals include expanding both the scope and impact of research programs as well as increasing the number of PhD graduates (from 200 (present) to 450 annually (~ 2020) and qualified faculty for Indian institutions.. IITM maintains academic friendship with several other educational institutes in the world through faculty and student/research scholar exchange programs. IITM has also been in the forefront in promoting Industry - Institute interaction through several innovative schemes. To further strengthen the linkages with the industry, the Industrial Associateship Scheme was started by IIT Madras in 1987. At present, about 230 industries and organizations from all over the country are members of this scheme._x000D_
IITM has nearly 200 active Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with global universities and industry, resulting in co-operative projects and assignments for mutual benefit.

GENERAL_x000D_
Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU) is the only comprehensive medical university in Japan that has both undergraduate and graduate programs in medicine and dentistry. The undergraduate programs are offered through the Faculty of Medicine and Faculty of Dentistry, and prepare students to be medical and dental professionals. Our graduate programs in Medical and Dental Sciences and Health Sciences produce leaders who go into research (basic research and clinical-based research), education or a combination of such work. Many professors teach and conduct cutting edge research in their respective Faculty or at one of our specialized research institutes, such as the Medical Research Institute or the Institute of Biomaterials and Bioengineering._x000D_
2. EDUCATION_x000D_
Today, approximately 3,000 students are pursuing medical, dental, and life science degrees at TMDU, with a nearly equal number of students in undergraduate and graduate programs. Undergraduates begin their career at the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences to ensure a well-rounded education. After moving on to the Faculty of Medicine or Faculty of Dentistry, students concentrate on a curriculum that is increasingly integrated between medical and dental sciences and utilizes an inter-professional educational approach, just as graduate students at TMDU have traditionally enjoyed._x000D_
In the effort to inspire an attitude of intellectual curiosity in its undergraduates, TMDU sends many students to different institutions, such as Imperial College London, King’s College London Dental Institute, and TMDU’s international outreach centers in Ghana, Chile, and Thailand. In addition, TMDU dispatches selected faculty members to Harvard Medical School for the purpose of spurring innovation in curriculum development. In all, TMDU offers over 200 life science degree programs at its two graduate schools. In addition, thousands of patients are treated daily at the attached university hospitals of medicine and dentistry, institutions that further facilitate the school’s educational efforts, basic and clinical research activities, and community service._x000D_
Strengthening governance and curriculum quality control to help realize TMDU’s vision for education, the Institute of Education has established in 2016 and assists in the drafting of a consistent university-wide policy that covers all aspects of TMDU’s educational functions, including the selection of applicants for admission, liberal arts education, undergraduate education, graduate school education, and continuing education, and the formulation of a curriculum firmly grounded in that policy. Through a continuous improvement in quality and long-term enhancement of the teaching capabilities of the faculty, the Institute of Education works to ensure that education at TMDU exceeds the international standard._x000D_
3. RESEARCH_x000D_
In April 2017, Institute of Research has been launched for organizing all TMDU research activities. This Institute formulates research strategies at this institution, and supports the implementation of advanced research. By promoting the collection and strategic use of research resources at TMDU and assisting in the creation, protection, and utilization of intellectual property, it facilitates cooperation among government, industry and academia._x000D_
Institute of Research has 8 centers to promote specialized research areas and also support and manage diverse research activities in TMDU from various angles. Among them, Bioresource Research Center has advanced facilities to collect and maintain high-quality data and tissue samples from patients at TMDU hospitals with the aim of discovering new causes for disease and developing personalized medicine. Research Center for Industry Alliances literally promotes collaboration between industry and TMDU research. In particular, Medical Innovation Promotion Center supports processes to make the novel knowledge and technology developed at TMDU translated into practical clinical use._x000D_
The new Organ and Tissue Neogenesis Consortium was launched in September 2017. It takes as its key concept “moving from regeneration to neogeneration.” Building on the foundation provided by TMDU’s accumulated experience and track record in regenerative medicine, it hopes to create a new paradigm of “neogenerative medicine” that goes beyond regenerative medicine. The consortium aims to build an international center for research on neogenerative medicine by working in concert with public institutions and with researchers and private companies in Japan and overseas. TMDU intends to accelerate efforts to train globally minded young professionals who will play an active role in the work of the consortium, both domestically and internationally._x000D_
In 2018, TMDU established a new framework “Open Innovation System“ to expand and accelerate our industry-oriented activities. Above all, it is notable that global companies such as Sony, Yamaha, Hitachi take advantage of the comprehensive open innovation partnership program to develop their business in medical and dental field. In these partnerships and all of its activities, TMDU has one ultimate goal: to serve the needs of patients and their families, in Japan and around the world, by working to fulfill its mission statement of “Cultivating Professionals with Knowledge and Humanity”._x000D_
4. INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION_x000D_
By strengthening international aspects of the TMDU and, in particular, promoting university-wide globalization in the fields of education, research, and medical treatment, the Institute of Global Affairs has been established in 2016 and aims to assist in achieving TMDU’s goal, as a world-leading integrated medical university under the vision of “Cultivating Professionals with Knowledge and Humanity, thereby Contributing to People’s Well-being”._x000D_
TMDU has been selected as an institution to receive support under Top Global University Project which the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) since 2014 to carry out education and research of the global level, which deserves to be ranked in the top 100 universities in the world._x000D_
Our concept which was highly appreciated at the time of selection is entitled, “Concept for cultivating human resources that can promote TMDU-type global health: taking on the challenge of improving the level of health on the global scale.” Aiming to improve the level of health on the global scale, Japan—based on its experience and accomplishments in the health care field—will serve a central role in achieving constructive continuance with the world and cultivating human resources that promote global health._x000D_
The university’s three overseas research/education centres are also central to its educational and research goals. The Ghana–TMDU Research Center at the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research at the University of Ghana concentrates on the research of emerging and re-emerging tropical diseases, including malaria, HIV, tuberculosis and neglected tropical diseases. The Latin American Collaborative Research Center in Chile builds on the foundation laid by TMDU, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and institutions in South America to detect and treat colon cancer at the earliest stage possible. The third centre, the Chulalongkorn University–TMDU Research and Education Collaboration Center in Thailand, facilitates a great deal of cooperation between the two schools, especially in the dental field._x000D_
TMDU currently has approximately 370 international students, who are predominantly enrolled in the graduate school. In fact, despite its relatively small size, TMDU has the largest number of international students in the medical and dental fields of any national/public university in Japan. TMDU not only hosts a large number of international students, but also annually sends about 300 students to mainly overseas affiliated universities to broaden and deepen their horisons. TMDU is also recruiting outstanding young scientists from around the world for assistant professorship positions focused on medical science research through its tenure track initiative._x000D_
TMDU has established two Joint Degree programs with the University of Chile (Chile) and the Chulalongkorn University (Thiland), and has been cooperatively working and cultivating long-lasting relationsships, to advance the educational philosophy of TMDU “To train medical professionals with a rich international quality”, and to enhance global competitiveness._x000D_
Joint Degree is an integrated, international academic program whereby Japanese and foreign universities jointly organize curricula and confer a single academic degree on a person completing the curricula under the names of the presidents of the universities concerned.",3011,9.7,1486,1,1525,18.2,35.7015151,139.7642375

The principal campuses (Central, Anchieta, Guajara and Ofra) of this learning institution are located in the city of La Laguna, which was declared World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1999, although it also has other centres scattered throughout Santa Cruz de Tenerife. As of academic year 2009/ 2010, the university has 25,103 students, 1,764 professors and 843 administrative and services employees, and offers 41 bachelor degrees and 30 postgraduate degrees regarding all knowledge areas. Its history expands through more than 200 years. First known as “Universidad de San Fernando” (University of St. Ferdinand), a Royal Decree from king Carlos IV ordered on March 11, 1792 the creation of the first literary university in the Canary Islands in La Laguna, which was then the capital of Tenerife. However, the unstable political landscape after 1793 made it impossible to follow through with the decree. The situation was solved after the restoration of Bourbon Dynasty, with another decree from king Fernando VII in 1816, in which it was finally established the creation of a university in the city of San Cristóbal de La Laguna named. It opened its doors on January 12, 1817, but the numerous shortcomings of the university, especially the lack of resources and the unstable teaching staff, led to a succession of orders to close and re-open the institution until it was definitively abolished in 1845 by a Royal Order that reduced the number of universities in Spain to ten and ordained the creation of the Canaries Institute in La Laguna. During a visit of Alfonso XIII to the institute in 1906, its director, Adolfo Cabrera Pinto, asked the King to re-establish the university. His petition was rewarded in 1913 by a decree that opened the first academic year of the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters and Law preparation, and the history of the University of La Laguna as we know it finally started. During the 20th century, the institution increased in studies, facilities and number of students, teachers and researchers. Two hundred years after it was founded, it continues to be a point of reference in the Canarian community and also reaches out to the world across the Atlantic. In 2010 it joined forces with the other higher learning institution from Canary Islands (the Universitiy of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria) to develop the project ""Campus Atlántico Tricontinental"" (Tri-continental Atlantic Campus), which has gained a quality mention from the Spanish Ministry of Education. This initiative aims to increase the international influence of Canary Island’s universities in South America, North Africa and Europe, especially in research areas such astrophysics, alternative energies and sea studies.",19369,4.3,18049,4.2,1320,5,,

Founded in the eighth century AD, the School reached its peak between the 10th and 13th century. In addition to medicine, its lectures included philosophy, theology and law. Closed by royal decree in 1811 under Joachim Murat’s Napoleonic government, the School earned Salerno the title of Hippocratica Civitas (City of Hippocrates) after the famous Greek physician and treatise writer. In 1944, by decree of king Victor Emmanuel III, the Istituto Universitario di Magistero “Giovanni Cuomo” was founded. This became state-owned in 1968, changing its name into Facoltà di Magistero dell’Università degli Studi di Salerno. Within a few years, the Faculty was joined by many others which contributed to the formation of a major university. The Faculty of Arts was established in 1969; then the Faculty of Economics (1970); the Faculty of Mathematical, Physical and Natural Sciences and the Faculty of Law (1972); the Full Degree in Engineering (1983); the Faculty of Pharmacy (1991); the Faculty of Political Science (1992); the Faculty of Foreign Languages and Literature (1996); finally, the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery (2006). As of 2013, in accordance with Law 240/2010, the faculties have been reorganized, the departments reconfigured and their respective functions redesigned. The University – which currently counts around 40,000 students – has a very large catchment area including, beside Campania, the Italian regions of Basilicata, Calabria and Apulia. Since 1987, the University has had its headquarters in the Irno Valley, a few kilometers from Salerno, at the junction of motorway intersections that make it central and easy to reach. Organized in the form of a campus (the Fisciano and Baronissi campuses), the University boasts modern facilities and efficient services for orientation, teaching, studying and leisure. It is a very large and still expanding complex, which covers an area of about one hundred thousand square meters._x000D_
Modern service centres – such as libraries, the International/Erasmus Office, the University Language Centre, the University Centre for Orientation and Mentoring, the Placement Office, the Spin-Off Incubator – represent vital and valuable support for training. Furthermore, the Campus offers many other services such as residence halls for students and teachers, sports facilities, an indoor swimming pool, a theatre, a lecture hall, a nursery, open-air museum of contemporary art, parking areas, green areas and a thematic arboretum, thus providing a student-friendly environment to facilitate the entire academic journey. Thus, from traditionally being a place for integration of learning, the University becomes a place for integration of projects, cultures and - above all – people, by constantly encouraging study, research and life experiences to enhance cultural and human growth._x000D_
The mission of the University of Salerno is to carry out research and educational programmes, developing links with the surrounding area while respecting the environment, with the aim of creating, enriching and, at the same time, offering a scientific, cultural heritage to students, enterprises, institutions and in general to the whole community. In keeping with this mission and core values, which are a constant reference point, the institutional goals are as follows: Research, Teaching and Education, Support for outstanding students and the diversely able, Development of the Campus as a community of individuals who share the same interests and values, Development of links with key players in the local area.",36156,1.1,22012,0.9,14144,1.4,33.653933,-117.8109
